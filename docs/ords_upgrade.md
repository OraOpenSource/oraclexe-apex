# Upgrading ORDS

To upgrade ORDS, you need to grab the latest copy of ORDS onto your server. Before starting the upgrade, it won't be a bad idea to stop Tomcat.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop tomcat@oxar
```

Now, assuming the version you wish to upgrade to is 3.0.4.60.12.48, and you have downloaded the file `ords.3.0.4.60.12.48.zip` onto your server, you first need to extract the files.

```bash
unzip ords.3.0.4.60.12.48.zip -d ords304
```

Now that the latest ORDS files have been extracted to your server, we can begin to upgrade. It's a matter of launching ords and specifying the configuration directory (OXAR places the configuration for ords in `/etc`).

```bash
cd ords304
java -jar ords.war
```

Here, you will be prompted to answer some questions, as per:

Once, that upgrade process completes, you need to move `ords.war` to the Tomcat webapps directory, before starting up Tomcat again.

```bash
sudo cp ords.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
sudo systemctl start tomcat@oxar
```
